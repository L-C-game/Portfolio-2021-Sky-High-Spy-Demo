# Portfolio-2021-Sky-High-Spy-Demo
Sky High Spy - Created as the final project for the SWiCS Sumo Digital Academy Workshops.

Language: C++, Framework: PlayBuffer - provided by Sumo Digital During the SWiCS Game Development using C++ course. Spyder and Playbuffer are both the intellectual property of Sumo Digital Ltd. 
Sky High Spy is an arcade style game in which you must guide agent 8 between asteroids while avoiding meteors and trying to attain the highest score possible. 
The game consists of: a title/controls state, a main game state and a game over state. 

There are multiple powerup gems to assist Agent 8:
    +5 score
    Speed boost
    Shield
Each with audio-visual feedback to improve game feel.

This project was created following object-oriented design principles utilising a hierarchical class structure. Finite State machines were created for the relevant objects using enums. This allowed for easy switching between states when certain criteria were met. The most elaborate state machine was used in the player class which handles the player's interactions with the environment. Geometry was used to create the movement of the player and the particle effects.
